#### Demand Forecasting - Service Parts in the Eletric Vehicle Industry](https://github.com/rayylin/Demand-Forecasting-Example--Service-Parts-in-the-Eletric-Vehicle-Industry)

Effective demand forecasting helps businesses optimize inventory, streamline production, improve raw material orders, and maintain cash flow. I will use Time Series, XGBoost, and Lasso to forecast service part demand in the Electric Vehicle industry. Additionally, I’ll demonstrate location pooling for rare, costly parts to reduce demand variability through risk pooling. Finally, I will explore methods to enhance forecasting accuracy and address demand forecasting challenges for supersession or NPI projects with no historical data.
