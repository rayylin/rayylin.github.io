#### Demand Forecasting - Service Parts in the Eletric Vehicle Industry](https://github.com/rayylin/Demand-Forecasting-Example--Service-Parts-in-the-Eletric-Vehicle-Industry)

Good demand forecasting could help businesses manage their inventory levels, arrange production schedules, improve ordering patterns of raw materials, and maintain healthier cash flow. I will use Time Series, XGBoost, and Lasso to forecast the demand for service parts in the Electric Vehicle Industry. Also, I will demonstrate how to perform location pooling for some expensive, rare-used parts. The risk pooling approach can put several supply-chain flows into one flow, thereby reducing demand variability. Furthermore, I will discuss how to improve forecasting accuracy and perform demand forecasting when you have no historical data; in other words, how to handle supersession or NPI projects.
