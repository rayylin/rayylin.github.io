- Python, Sql Server, 
[<img src="./images/Forecasting.png?raw=true"/>](https://github.com/rayylin/Demand-Forecasting-Example--Service-Parts-in-the-Eletric-Vehicle-Industry)

Effective demand forecasting helps businesses optimize inventory, streamline production, improve raw material orders, and maintain cash flow. I will use Time Series, XGBoost, and Lasso to forecast service part demand in the Electric Vehicle industry. Additionally, Iâ€™ll demonstrate location pooling for rare, costly parts to reduce demand variability through risk pooling. Finally, I will explore methods to enhance forecasting accuracy and address demand forecasting challenges for supersession or NPI projects with no historical data.

<img src="./images/SapForecasting2.png?raw=true"/>
This project performs a demand forecast of an electronic part. Demand forecasting is an important issue that could help businesses better allocate resources and arrange their production schedule. We have the sales data for the past two years. The product is sold in 235 locations and has 223,769 transactions. We focus on the US only. The raw data includes six columns, Location, Code, Year, Day, Sales, and Continent. We use SAP to perform demand forecasting with the Time Series model. We use Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to evaluate the performance. The MAPE value is 3.46%

#### Data Pipeline for Maintenance Management
- Alterxy, SQL Server
<img src="./images/Pipeline1.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="./images/Pipeline2.png?raw=true"/>
Managing maintenance plans for vehicles with thousands of parts is time-consuming. This project uses Alteryx to automate the process via a data pipeline. The model extracts data from CSV files and SQL Server, calculates vehicles needing maintenance, and forecasts upcoming maintenance demands. It updates critical information automatically each month.

#### Inventory Management System
- C#(.Net), SQL Server
<img src="./images/InvMgn.png?raw=true"/>
An Inventory Management System can help companies manage their orders, inventory, and customers. In this project, we use C# and .net to write an inventory management system. The system uses SQL Server as its database.

#### [Sales Performance Tracking Dashboard](https://github.com/rayylin/Power-BI_Purchase_order_analysis)
- Power BI, Sql Server, Python
[<img src="./images/PerformanceTrack.png?raw=true"/>](https://github.com/rayylin/Power-BI_Purchase_order_analysis)
In this project, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to track KPIs, analyze sales data, and improve decision-making. It visualizes actual vs. expected sales, transaction, and store data, helping identify trends and factors affecting sales. Users can drill down for detailed insights on products, salespersons, and stores.
